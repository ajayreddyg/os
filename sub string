Aim:- To write a program for searching a substring in a given text by using shell 
programming.
Algorithm:-
To select a substring from string using ${string: starting position :root position} 2) 
Comparing two strings is done by {$s1=$s2} 3) To check for zero length string use [-z 
String] 4) To check for empty string use [String] 5) To check for non zero length string use â€“
n as [-n $string] 6) The length of string is obtained by ${#string}
Program:-
echo "Enter Main String: "
read s
echo "Enter substring : "
read ss 
prefix=${s%%$ss*}
index=${#prefix}
if [[ index -eq ${ss} ]];
then 
echo "Substring is not present in string "
else
echo "Index of substring in string :$index"
fi
